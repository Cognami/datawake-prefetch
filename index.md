DataWake Prefetch scours the internet for user provided keywords, scrapes those pages and provides the user a ranked list of the websites containing those keywords.

## How it works
DataWake Prefetch consists of a Firefox Add-on, web server, and a distributed crawler. Searches are based on user provided keywords. The search results are then scraped and ranked based on those keywords.


## Applied Technology  ##
This work was funded by [DARPA's
Memex](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Memex.aspx) program
and leverages several technologies from [DARPA's Open
Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/).  DataWake Prefetch is available on the [Memex Open Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/MEMEX.html)
